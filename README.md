### why hello there

I'm a college student, aspring developer, and professional dumbass. That's... all I have to say for now.

Nothing I've made is particularly interesting yet, but feel free to have a look around.

You can contact me via Discord (username: duckemz) if you'd like to talk about anything.

Check out my website [here](https://dukemz.github.io)!
